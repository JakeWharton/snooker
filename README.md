Snooker
=======

Snooker is like Pool for sophisticated people.

More rationally, it is a standalone bundling of classes from `android.util.*`
which deal with object pooling.

*Hat tip to Jeff Gilfelt who [beckons you][1] to use these classes.*

# DEPRECATED

Please use `Pool` in the [support library v20.0.0][2] or newer for these features.
